# Command-Recognition-Project
A Deep Learning project that recognizes some commands (go, stop, right, left, up, down, on, off) using CNN, and deployment of this project in Web page.

### Used technologies:
-- Regarding to many papers about audio recognition, researchers figured out that CNN is the best Neural Network used in this field,

-- I used melspectrogram-based model as it return the best accuracy after training on my data, raw signal, mfcc were put in consider also.


# How to run this project

### Software requirements
-- Python programing language

-- used libraries:
>1- numpy 2- pandas 3- matplotlib 4- seaborn</br> 5- Ipython 6- librosa 7- wave 8- pyaudio</br>9- tensorflow (keras)</br>

-- dataset

### Hardware Requirments
-- GPU for training model (not required)

--  At least 4 Gb ram to load data


# How to use this project
-- First, you need to meet SW requirments

-- Second, run th main.py file

-- Last open the website locally on any browser.

### Future updates

For future work I intend to use more reliable dataset to have better accuracy,

I need to increase the number of commands to recognize, 

I need to use better way of deployment rather than web deployment that is not the best method for command recognition applications.
