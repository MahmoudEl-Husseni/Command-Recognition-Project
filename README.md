# Command-Recognition-Project
A Deep Learning project that recognizes some commands (go, stop, right, left, up, down, on, off) using CNN, and deployment of this project in Web page.

### used technologies:
-- Regarding to many papers about audio recognition, researchers figured out that CNN is the best Neural Network used in this field,
-- I used melspectrogram-based model as it return the best accuracy after training on my data, raw signal, mfcc were put in consider also.


# how to run this project

### Software requirements
-- Python programing language
-- used libraries:
1- numpy
2- pandas
3- matplotlib
4- seaborn

5- Ipython
6- librosa
7- wave
8- pyaudio

9- tensorflow (keras)

### Hardware Requirments
-- GPU for training model (not required)
--  at least 4 Gb ram to load data


# how to use this project
-- first, you need to meet SW requirments
-- second, run th main.py file
-- last open the website locally on any browser.

### Future updates

for future work I intend to use more reliable dataset to have better accuracy,
I need to increase the number of commands to recognize, 
I need to use better way of deployment rather than web deployment that is not the best method for command recognition applications.
